### Descripton: 
The Beam Calculator is a web application to calculate the internal forces for continuous beams withs two to five spans and a continuous line load. This is a useful tool for civil engineers, especailly for structural engineering. It can also help students controlling their hand calculations. 
The user can input the number of spans, the length of the span and a value for the continous line load. After calculation, the user is directed to a new page. The page contains a table that summarizes the input data, a table with the results, including all relevant internal forces of the beam as well as the support forces. At the bootom of the page two diagrams show the torque curve and the shear force progression. 
The four buttons at the bottom enable the user to either start a new calculation, download the result values in csv-format, download the diagrams or print the whole page to pdf. The pdf-file can be useful as a summary of the results.
The backend of the application consists of a file called app.py which is the application itself.
